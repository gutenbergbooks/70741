<p>Home ownership is the largest factor in the solution of the so-called
negro problem. Cooperative extension work, especially since the
comprehensive organization of negro extension agents, has been one
of the greatest influences in encouraging and helping negroes to
become landowners and to succeed with land investments. Energetic
negroes soon learn thrift and have the ability to become good
demonstrators.</p>

obtaining a permanent upbuilding of the negro farm community in the South. That negro
agents are building well is indicated by their success in influencing the construction of 569 new
houses, the remodeling of 1,002 old houses, and the beautification of 1,336 home grounds during 1924.</p>

<p>In most parts of the Cotton Belt it has been possible during the
last few years for farmers to make a good living and to make a profit
besides. The migration to the North has perceptibly slackened,
and thousands of negroes who have been getting good wages as
carpenters, bricklayers, mechanics, and other artisans in near-by
and distant cities are saving money to buy land. Many of them
left their families at home and are sending them money for their
support and for building savings accounts to be used in buying a
farm home. (Fig. <a href="#image003">1</a>.) Of course, a large percentage will remain in
the industrial centers of the North, but the negro’s love for his folks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
and for the soil will influence many to begin payments on farms at a
time when wages are high and when such crops as cotton, tobacco,
and peanuts are bringing good prices. Negroes, as a rule, know how
to grow the cash crops, and it has been found in many sections that
negroes succeed with poultry, truck, dairying, and other diversified
interests when they own their own small farms.</p>

</figure>

<p>Because of the inevitable economic changes resulting from the
World War, many large plantations have been cut up and sold at low
prices. In some sections of the South, chambers of commerce and
other business organizations have been promoting campaigns to
encourage negroes to become landowners. In 1920 about 217,500
negroes in the Southern States owned their farms and about 703,500
were tenants. In some States negroes have been buying farms
faster than white people, and the rapid increase of ownership during
the last five years is most noticeable. It is not surprising that it
has taken a backward race a long time to acquire property and
develop farms. It takes white agricultural college graduates quite
a while to do that. The next 25 years unquestionably will witness
a marked contrast to the first quarter of the century in this regard.
It is well that the development is taking place along the lines of the
negro’s training and disposition. All of this confirms the judgment
of Booker T. Washington, the negro educator, who said:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>The negro is, in my opinion, naturally a farmer, and he is at his very best
when he is in close contact with the soil. (Fig. <a href="#image004">2</a>.) There is something in
the atmosphere of the farm that develops and strengthens the negro’s natural
common sense. As a rule, the negro farmer has a rare gift of getting at the sense
of things and of stating in picturesque language what he has learned. The
explanation of it is, it seems to me, that the negro farmer studies nature. In
his own way he studies the soil, the development of plants and animals, the
streams, the birds and the changes of the seasons. He has a chance of getting
at first-hand the kind of knowledge that is valuable to him.</p>
</div>

<p>During the last few years many persons from different parts of
Africa have visited this country to study our methods of industrial
and agricultural education. Some of them have been Government
officials, some teachers in schools and colleges, and some missionaries.
They represented many different nationalities, all of which are interested
in the welfare of dark-skinned people. Such visitors are
always interested in Hampton and Tuskegee Institutes and usually
have a scholastic point of view when they arrive. On their return,
however, they are always enthusiastic about the men and women
extension agents whose primary responsibility is to reach the farm
and home. They see greater significance in demonstrations which
proceed from the farm and home to the school than they do in those
which go from the school to the farm. They seem to realize that
the home is the fundamental unit of civilization and that the agents
are the apostles of a better farm and home life, and therefore return
to their work with an optimistic determination to encourage demonstration
work in their countries.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="DEVELOPMENT_OF_NEGRO_EXTENSION_WORK">
DEVELOPMENT OF NEGRO EXTENSION WORK</h2>
<h3>EARLY HISTORY</h3>
</div>

<p>Farmers’ cooperative demonstration work was begun in 1903. At
first, all demonstration agents were white men and women. They
enrolled negro demonstrators who followed instructions so faithfully
and carefully that they were often more successful than white farmers
and home makers. Many instances were reported of negro farmers
who got started along the pathway of success because of the stimulation
of such demonstrations. County agricultural agents often
reported that 25 per cent of their demonstrators were negroes and
that many negroes attended the field meetings and public demonstrations.</p>

<p>Booker T. Washington had a prominent part in beginning negro
extension work in the South. Tuskegee Institute, which he founded
in Alabama, already had carried instruction to negro farmers through
its faculty, through farm conferences at Tuskegee and in local communities,
and through printed bulletins. Doctor Washington also
used a “Jesup wagon,” provided with agricultural equipment to go
out among farmers and demonstrate better farming methods. Washington,
H. B. Frissell, of Hampton Institute, Va., and Seaman A.
Knapp of the United States Department of Agriculture, worked out
the relation of Hampton and Tuskegee Institutes with the department
and made arrangements for the appointment in 1906 of T. M.
Campbell, of Tuskegee Institute, the first negro demonstration agent,
and of J. B. Pierce, of Hampton Institute, a few days later.</p>

<p>In speaking of extension work a few years afterwards, Washington
said:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>It would be impossible to describe here all the ramifications or all the various
forms which this extension work has taken in recent years. The thing that I
wish to emphasize, however, is that we are seeking in this work less to teach
(according to the old-fashioned notion of teaching) than to improve conditions.</p>
</div>

<p>His was a spirit of service. In the same connection he expressed in
the following excerpt an unusual and unique opinion of the pedagogy
of extension work. His experience and his observations constitute a
great inspiration for negro extension agents and educators generally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>I have sometimes regarded it as a fortunate circumstance that I never studied
pedagogy. If I had done so, every time I attempted to do anything in a new
way I should have felt compelled to reckon with all the past, and in my case that
would have taken so much time that I should never have got anywhere. As it
was, I was perfectly free to go ahead and do whatever seemed necessary at the
time, without reference to whether that same thing had ever been done by anyone
else at any previous time or not.</p>
</div>

<p>General Armstrong, who founded Hampton Institute in Virginia
for Negroes and Indians in the reconstruction days immediately
following the Civil War, expressed somewhat the same idea when he
said:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Many teachers seem to me to have disproportionate ideas of the forces that
make up man. * * * There is plenty of study of methods and not enough
study of men or of the problems of life.</p>
</div>

<p>Negro home demonstration work was also developed through the
interest and aid of white agents. White supervisory agents still take
sympathetic interest in negro extension activities. In view of the
fact that negro women and girls had always done much of the domestic
labor in southern homes and because negro schools and colleges had
given courses in home economics, home demonstration work for
negroes was started in the best possible environment and atmosphere.
Many white home demonstration agents and demonstrators took
pleasure in giving instruction in gardening, canning, and preserving to
negro women and girls whom they knew. But, as the work developed,
it soon became apparent that negro women agents could get access to
negro homes better than anybody else, so negro home demonstration
agents began to be appointed. Annie Peters, of Boley, Okla., was
appointed on January 23, 1912, as the first negro home demonstration
agent, and Mattie Holmes, of Hampton Institute, Va., on May 24,
1912, as the second. Other appointments followed rapidly.</p>

<p>It has been possible to build up an extension organization in the
South for negro people, because of such institutions as Hampton and
Tuskegee. In fact, the influence of these two major institutions has
affected all the schools and colleges where negro agents have been
educated. Many smaller similar institutions have also contributed
much to extension work. Table 1 gives the percentage of negro men
and women extension agents who were graduated from Tuskegee and
Hampton Institutes and from the State agricultural colleges.</p>

<p>In beginning farm and home demonstration work for negroes in
1906, the cooperation of the General Education Board of New York
was most valuable and effective. The board was liberal in its appropriations
and generous in the arrangements for the expenditure of
them. The money was turned over to the authorities of the United
States Department of Agriculture to be used as they thought best in
starting and promoting the work. It was because of the demonstrated
success of this plan of education that the National, State, and
county authorities were more disposed to support it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>When it is realized that various Southern States are gradually
increasing the appropriations to the State agricultural colleges, and
also that a $9,000,000 endowment fund for Hampton and Tuskegee is
being completed, it is possible to look forward to better-trained negro
agents. Progress can be faster now because the way is clear. Every
Southern State now has a group of efficient negro agents, whose
numbers are increasing. (Fig. <a href="#image005">3</a>.)</p>

<p>In view of the facts that Booker T. Washington gave the credit for
his own success to the influence General Armstrong had over his life
and that Tuskegee Institute is an extension and modified enlargement
of Hampton Institute, it is well to trace a further development of
such teaching and also to get the observation of the recognized leaders.
Long before the World War and before the migration of negroes to the
North, Booker T. Washington saw the South as the permanent home
of his people and he urged them to develop the resources of climate,
soil, forests, and folks. He saw conditions clearly and urged his
people to train for skill, to practice thrift, and to grow better by doing
better. This was the best of preparation for the negro agency force
now in the field.</p>

<p>In the first farmers’ conference at Tuskegee in February, 1892,
which, by the way, was the forerunner of farm congresses at agricultural
colleges for white people in various parts of the country, the
following resolution, among other important deliverances, was
adopted:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>In view of our general condition, we would suggest the following remedies:
(1) That as far as possible we aim to raise at home our own meat and bread;
(2) that as fast as possible we buy land, even though a very few acres at a time;
(3) that a larger number of our young people be taught trades, and that they
be urged to prepare themselves to enter as largely as possible all the various
vocations of life; (4) that we especially try to broaden the field of labor for our
women; (5) that we make every sacrifice and practice every form of economy
that we may purchase land and free ourselves from our burdensome habit of
living in debt; (6) that we urge our ministers and teachers to give more attention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
to the material condition and home life of the people; (7) that we urge our people
not to depend entirely upon the State to provide schoolhouses and lengthen the
time of the schools, but to take hold of the matter themselves where the State
leaves off, and by supplementing the public funds from their own pockets and by
building schoolhouses, bring about the desired results; (8) that we urge patrons
to give earnest attention to the mental and moral fitness of those who teach their
schools; (9) that we urge the doing away with all sectarian prejudice in the
management of the schools.</p>

<p>It has been extension experience that negroes are especially responsive
to the demonstration method, because of their faith, confidence,
and optimism. Demonstrations have reached the most ignorant and
most needy better than any form of academic instruction, because
demonstrators must be doers before they become teachers. The
effect and power of a demonstration are measured by the success of
the enterprise and the standing and influence of the demonstrator.
The demonstration method has proved to be not only the best for
the ignorant, but also for the intelligent. Certainly the more intelligent
farmers can carry object lessons further than the ignorant ones.
Furthermore, it is safe to assume a fair amount of good farm and home
development in an intelligent, prosperous community. Perhaps one
reason why farmers tire of institutes and lectures is because they feel
that they have reached a stage of knowledge where they can do things
fairly well and have thus become teachers and leaders themselves.
They do not care to accumulate a lot of information upon diverse
subjects just for the purpose of acquiring information. They want
usable knowledge upon specific things. (Fig. <a href="#image006">4</a>.) The negro has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
made sufficient progress for extension agents to find men, women,
boys, and girls in every community who can demonstrate better
farming and home making.</p>

<p>The history of extension work for negroes has not been exactly
parallel to that of the whites in the Southern States. The white
agents started work with men demonstrators, followed in succession
by boys, girls, and women. Negro work started with men and women
first. The agents tried to meet the most urgent needs of the farms
and homes. At the time when the Department of Agriculture and
State agricultural colleges first began to appoint negro agents, the
club work of white boys and girls had drifted somewhat away from
the demonstration feature and was emphasizing the club feature.
When the negro agents began later to enroll boys and girls they did
so because they felt that these young folks should have an influence
in farming and in home making in their communities. It was not so
much a matter of teaching and telling as it was of doing and growing.
One agent expressed it by saying, “We are emphasizing work rather
than clubs.” Of course, in the natural process of evolution, agents
came to pay more attention to meetings, organization, recreation,
and group activities in general, but the central theme is the demonstration.</p>

<p>Negro club members have manifested a disposition for the boy to
do the farming and the girl the home making. That tendency is
general in all extension work, of course, but the line of differentiation
has not been so clear in adult activities. Because of the limited
funds available, few counties have been able to afford both negro
men and women agents. Thus it comes about that the men agents
do more home work and the women agents more farm work than in
counties employing both county agricultural and home demonstration
agents. As time goes on and more agents are appointed, this
matter will adjust itself.</p>

<p>During the present period of readjustment and reconstruction it
is becoming more and more apparent to students of extension work
that the greatest ultimate reform will take place where the most
successful demonstration of content and size are conducted and where
such demonstrations are multiplied in the greatest numbers. Many
negro agents seem to have the ability to encourage their demonstrators
and magnify the influence of their work. They have caught the
philosophy of the founder of demonstration work, Seaman A. Knapp,
when he said, “Your value lies not in what you can do but in what
you can get other people to do.” Negro agents seem to appreciate
the standing in the community of a man or woman who has done
better work than anybody else. They enter into the thought and
life of the demonstrator who estimated that more than 50 men in
his neighborhood had been influenced by his success with 10 acres
of cotton along the roadside. They know that the boy who said,
“My club acre has been noticed by many people in this section and
I am sure it will cause some of my boy friends to join the club next
year,” had developed in himself the real spirit of service. They appreciate
the feeling of pride and satisfaction that came to the girl
club member who raised a dairy calf, built a good house for it, and
then saw more than a dozen like it built within a radius of 5 miles
of her home. (Fig. <a href="#image008">5</a>.) The result has been to make each person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
carrying on a demonstration feel that he has a responsibility as a
leader and teacher in his community.</p>

<p>The culminating evidence of these efforts toward improvement
through the object-lesson method is found in the results obtained in
home and lawn beautification. Particularly in recent years negro
extension agents have brought about marked progress in the renovation,
painting, and whitewashing of houses and outbuildings, and in
the growing of flowers, grass, and shrubbery in the front yards.</p>

<h3>VALUE OF COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATIONS</h3>

were far-reaching in that her neighbors and friends were inspired to follow the best dairy
practices in an effort to emulate her successful results.</p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Negro farmers have manifested considerable interest in cooperative
marketing. They belong to cotton, tobacco, peanut, potato, and
similar associations. They usually follow carefully instructions in
grading and standardization. They appreciate the opportunity of
purchasing fertilizers and other supplies through the farm bureau
and other organizations engaged in such enterprises. In some counties
where associations have given special attention to marketing
carloads of hogs, chickens, potatoes, pecans, and other products
produced in surplus quantities, the negroes do their share. It has
come about that most marketing plans which have been developed
include negroes in their operations better than any other form of
productive and educational enterprise. In cooperative-marketing
associations the commodity is considered rather than the person or
the community. Clarendon County, S. C., is a very good example
of such development. The market bureau, which was established<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
at the suggestion of the county agricultural agent and which is conducted
largely under his direction and guidance, has the names of
more than 700 negroes on its mailing list. These negroes have cooperated
not only by shipping potatoes, hogs, peanuts, chickens, and
other commodities, but by procuring better seed and stock in order
to grow products of better quality for shipment. As this work
develops in any community it gradually brings about a general
improvement. It begins with individuals but always influences the
entire community. (Fig. <a href="#image009">6</a>.)</p>

and allow her more time for self-improvement and recreation. Such demonstrations by local men or
women have stimulated the adoption of good practices and have done much to bring about a general
community improvement.</p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Such cooperation has increased self-respect and has strengthened
mutual confidence. This activity has emphasized the fact that men
and women limited in ambition and will power may be greatly stimulated
to successful effort by the esteem and encouragement of their
neighbors. The county agricultural agent of Clarendon County
reported that every negro farmer in his county knows No. 1, No. 2,
and Jumbo potatoes. He also reported that they are striving to
produce No. 1’s because they realize that products of such quality
will receive the commendation of everybody concerned and also will
bring in larger returns. This realization of the value of superior
products has brought about a great improvement in the type of
chickens, pigs, and other farm animals raised for market.</p>

<p>Marketing has tended to unify and systematize extension organization
in the counties more than any other work that has been done thus
far. It has enlisted the active interest of all farmers, both white and colored,
and of local business men. Some of the counties which will
have full quotas of both white and colored extension agents, and
good representative working organizations are developing extension
programs to a fuller degree than has been possible heretofore. It
is an enormous task to change the customs and habits of centuries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
or even of decades. Negroes who have grown practically nothing
but cotton are slow to become dairymen, poultrymen, and truckers.
They change mainly because of economic necessity.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3>EVOLUTION OF PLAN</h3>
</div>

<p>The evolution of an agricultural plan of work among negroes, in a
general way, followed that of the whites. It began with demonstrations
in the improvement of staple crops and then proceeded step by
step into crop diversification, animal husbandry, and conservation.
The whole development may be briefly expressed as follows: Crop
production, livestock production, soil building, and marketing.
Fortunately, this program is so logical and so appropriate that
demonstrators and club members are naturally disposed to follow it.
This does not mean that they all do the same things at the same
time. In livestock activities, one group may be emphasizing dairy
cattle and another hogs. The retroactive influence upon crop production
in one direction and soil improvement in another is very
potent. Seaman A. Knapp evidently had this whole evolution in
mind, and he was familiar with the work among negroes, when he
told the agents not to go before the people with elaborate programs.
He said: “The average man, like the crow, can not count more than
three. Do the next thing.” General Armstrong was dealing with
the same people and, to some extent, with the same thought when
he said, “I try to get at bottom facts, and then take the next step.”</p>

<p>A general agricultural plan of work, of course, is applicable everywhere
at any time. It is flexible, and requires individual initiative and
resourcefulness. The more experienced farmers and club boys will
be in the advanced stages while the novices will be taking the first
step. The whole procedure goes forward in cycles. As each cycle
comes around, modification and adaptation take place in accordance
with the progress science has made in the meantime. For instance,
in corn demonstrations in most parts of the South, where, in former
years, farmers planted one-ear varieties, they are now using prolific
varieties, especially where interplantings of peas and beans and where
hogging down and grazing are to be done.</p>

<p>The Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station recently came to
the conclusion that vetch is the best winter legume for most of the
soils in Alabama. Thousands of negro farmers have accepted that
instruction and are using vetch as a winter legume and soil improver.
The negro farmers have also accepted the teachings of the experiment
station in regard to the kinds and quantities of fertilizers to be used.</p>

<p>The negro home program also has been developed through certain
logical processes, which may be indicated briefly as follows: Production,
utilization, construction, and beautification. This, too, is a natural
program which may be followed consciously and intuitively by
every person who is properly started in the work. The negro women
and girls commence with growing vegetables in the gardens, beginning
with the most needed food crops and enlarging their operations
gradually. Then they undertake to conserve enough for home use
during the winter. They sell the surplus vegetables, both fresh and
canned. It is an easy step from canning vegetables to the preservation
of fruits. Better bread comes next because of its importance as
food and because flour, meal, and grains in general are available.
Then eggs and butter are standardized, and poultry meat is properly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
cooked and canned. Such activities, in turn, stimulate better work
with pork, beef, and other meats.</p>

<p>Success in such enterprises suggests and encourages home improvement,
involving demonstrations in rearranging kitchens, living rooms,
and homes in general. Better furniture is procured and paint and
whitewash are in demand. Demonstrations with textiles and fabrics
are considered incidentally all along. The girls and women want
simple neat dresses in their work. The club idea suggests uniforms
for public demonstrations and meetings. In hundreds of instances
the program culminates with an attractive new home in a setting
of trees, shrubbery, and flowers. Such a self-developed program, the
germs of which exist in the plans and hopes of the people who are
actually doing the work on the farms and in the homes, is infinitely
more important than one developed for them.</p>

<p>It is fortunate that negro extension work started with demonstrations
by individual farmers instead of with organization for instruction
purposes. Organization arose spontaneously. People who did
the same kind of work in the same way were easily organized. Negro
farmers and members of their families who had the same kind of
poultry, for instance, and who built the same kind of houses, were
brought together for mutual stimulation, help, and instruction.
Every farmer who had an object lesson in growing vetch, soy beans,
velvet beans, or peanuts was glad to join a tour to see similar activities
on farms in other parts of his county. Field meetings, tours, camps,
and short courses have the elements and principles of organization
within them. They constitute a focus or converging point for activities
that are mutual. If the white agents who did negro work in
the beginning or the negro agents who took it up later had proceeded
on an organization basis first, the whole proposition would have been
misunderstood by both white and colored people.</p>

<p>Observation of the experience of the people who made negro extension
work possible and its success notable, naturally calls attention
to the elementary methods which have been used. The various
processes may be stated in a half dozen words: Consultation, demonstration,
emulation, publication, organization, and multiplication.
Whether the agents are working with the approximately 217,500
negroes who own their own farms or with the 703,500 who are tenants,
deliberation, conference, and good judgment are required to establish
the work without creating friction. In the pioneer counties,
where the demonstrations were most successful, the introduction was
done in a quiet way. The general public did not know much about
it until good object lessons in crop production were available, and
nothing prevents or stops criticism so readily as successful demonstrations.
If the demonstrators have been carefully selected, if
they are men whose conduct has been exemplary, the conviction is
all the stronger.</p>

<p>The first negro demonstrators were proud to wear the button furnished
by the Department of Agriculture containing the word “Demonstrator.”
These buttons were often given out in churches as
awards of merit and distinction. Negroes are very susceptible to
commendation and praise. It means a lot to a man, woman, boy, or
girl, who has started out on a demonstration program, to receive
recognition from his pastor, his neighbors, and especially from the
leading white citizens. Whenever a county paper calls attention to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
the outstanding results obtained by a negro farmer, he immediately
measures up to the added responsibility and goes forward on the
path of improvement. Whenever there is a considerable number of
demonstrators of that kind, it is safe to do organization work along
agricultural and home-economics lines. In fact, negroes who have
demonstrated that kind of enterprise and dependability are ready for
cooperative marketing or other welfare organization. The great
task that is before the negro extension force is to multiply the numbers
of good demonstrators. In this way, they will develop leaders and
magnify the kind of activities which will meet with universal approval.</p>

<h3>GROWTH OF PERSONNEL AND FINANCES
<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h3>
</div>

<p>The gradual increase in the number of negro agents and also in the
appropriations for their support during the last 10 years gives much
promise for the development of this work in the future. On June
30, 1915, the end of the first year under the Smith-Lever Act, 49
negro men agents and 17 women agents were employed, and the
total cost of the work during the year was $31,589. In 1919, 459
negro men and women agents were employed and the cost was
$247,509. On June 30, 1924, the end of the first decade under the
Smith-Lever Act, 299 agents were employed, of whom 191 were men
and 108, women. The total amount expended during the fiscal year
1924 was $426,266, which was derived from Federal, State, and county
sources, and which represented the peak in the amount of money
devoted to this work. More agents were employed during the war
period, but many of them devoted only part time to extension work.
All things considered, therefore, negro extension work is making
steady and substantial progress every year.</p>

<p>From Table 3, page 28, it will be noted that the increase in the
number of negro extension agents and in the cost of maintaining them
went forward in two distinct stages during the 10-year period immediately
following the enactment of the Smith-Lever Act. The number
of agents and the number of club members increased very rapidly
during the World War, which was followed by a period of unrest and
transition. After that came a settling down and then an era of solid
and substantial development. There has been a gradual and steady
increase in the amount of money devoted to negro extension work.
Although it is true that not so many agents were on duty in 1924 as
in 1919, yet more than four times as many were employed in 1924
as in 1915. Furthermore, the finances had increased more than a
dozenfold. This indicates a better-trained class of negro agents and
a greater public willingness to support negro extension work.</p>

<p>Texas, which receives more Federal money than any other State,
had 36 negro agents in 1924 and spent $55,424 for their salaries,
travel, and other necessary expenses. Alabama had 34 negro agents,
men and women, and $50,057 was spent in the maintenance of their
work. Mississippi had 36 agents and the cost was $48,876. Virginia
had a total of 34 agents and the cost of maintaining this force was
$44,787. Georgia had 26 agents and expended $30,452. Several
other States have a large agency force and the financial support is
becoming more and more liberal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>The percentage of negroes to whites is different in each of the
Southern States and this fact would be taken into consideration in
any study of appropriations for negro work. At the last census,
Georgia had 1,689,114 white people and 1,206,365 negroes; Mississippi,
853,962 whites and 935,184 negroes; Alabama, 1,447,032
whites and 900,652 negroes; South Carolina, 818,538 whites and
864,719 negroes; North Carolina, 1,783,779 whites and 763,407
negroes; Texas, 3,918,165 whites and 741,694 negroes; Virginia,
1,617,909 whites and 690,017 negroes; and Oklahoma, 1,821,194
whites and 149,408 negroes.</p>

<p>It will be observed from Table 3 that practically all of the States
which took up negro extension work first have the greatest financial
support and the largest number of agents in proportion to their
negro population. Alabama and Virginia appointed their first
negro agents in 1906; Mississippi, in 1908; Georgia and South Carolina,
in 1909; Oklahoma, in 1910; North Carolina, in 1911; and the
other States in rapid succession.</p>

<p>It is greatly to the credit of the pioneer agents that their work has
met with the approval of county commissioners, boards of education,
and public authorities generally. Nothing is quite so encouraging
about the whole development as the wholesome public sentiment
which has sustained the work and encouraged the agents. This
support is based upon knowledge of good work done and results
achieved. A large metropolitan daily paper, speaking of the present
work of the man who was the first negro agent appointed by the
United States Department of Agriculture, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>His principal duties are to see that negro county agricultural agents obtain
outline maps of each county and properly distribute the work; that at least one
house in each county is built at stated intervals according to an approved plan;
that one or more electric lighting systems be undertaken in the county; that at
least one house be whitewashed or painted in each demonstration community;
that one or more water systems be undertaken in each county; that at least one
farmstead home grounds be developed in each community; that at least one
sanitary toilet be constructed in each demonstration community; that at least
one crop-rotation demonstration be given; that one or more permanent pastures
be established; that at least one person in each community be taught the use of
the farm level; that one year-round garden demonstration be established; that
at least one farm be properly laid out or plotted in each county; that one playground
be equipped in each community; and that one or more demonstration
orchards be established in each county.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="COOPERATION_WITH_OTHER_AGENCIES">COOPERATION WITH OTHER AGENCIES</h2>
</div>


<p>From several years’ experience it has been found that negro agents
cooperate closely with their schools and churches. Negro preachers
have great power and influence among their people, not only in matters
of religion, but also in farming and home making. Wherever
an agent obtains the indorsement of a negro pastor, and also gets
this pastor to do some good farming and make his home more attractive,
he gets assistance that is impossible to obtain from any
other source. A negro industrial school in a county is usually a
center of influence in extension work as well as in public service
generally. Such a school reenforces the instruction given by the
agents and is a gathering place for demonstrators and club members.
The demonstration activities improve and enhance the school work
to a considerable degree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>In addition to the cooperation given by churches and schools,
many organizations have assisted negro extension agents in carrying
out local extension programs. Much assistance in this respect has
been accorded by vocational educational workers, negro chambers
of commerce, lodges, health societies, negro farmers’ unions, federations
of women’s clubs, and others.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CLUB_WORK_BY_NEGRO_BOYS_AND_GIRLS">CLUB WORK BY NEGRO BOYS AND GIRLS</h2>
</div>


<p>As has already been indicated, 4-H club work among negro boys and
girls has been a secondary development, but it is now going forward
by leaps and bounds. The work by negro agents among adult negroes
was just getting
well started when the
Smith-Lever Act was
passed. The effect of
the act and of the increase
of funds resulting
from it was to
strengthen and reenforce
what was being
done for negro farmers
and home makers. As
was to be expected, the
boys and girls soon
wanted to follow in the
footsteps of their fathers
and mothers. (Fig.
<a href="#image014">7</a>.) There are excellent
prospects for junior extension
work in the
near future. In fact,
negro boys and girls
have been making records
that are stimulating
white club members
to greater effort
and endeavor.</p>

</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At the close of the 10-year
period there was
a total enrollment in
4-H club work in the Southern States of 21,721 negro boys and 27,114
negro girls. These figures show a big increase since 1916, when the
enrollment of 2,551 negro club members was first recorded separately.
At that time the State club agents suggested that negro boys should
be organized into farm-makers’ clubs and negro girls into homemakers’
clubs. Prior to that time many negro boys and girls were
enrolled in 4-H clubs, but they did not have such different classification
as to make their work stand out and receive proper emphasis
and recognition.</p>

<p>The end of the 10-year period also found a great many negro boys
and girls demonstrating to their parents, their neighbors, and the
world that they can clear $200 to $300 a year on their club enterprises
and at the same time keep up regular attendance at school during
the term provided for them by their respective counties and States.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
A 14-year-old boy or girl who can put $100 or more into a bank and
continue saving each year as he or she grows older is assured of an
education and a start in life. This gives the younger generation
a big advantage and also furnishes a great inspiration to the agents
who are working among these people. More work of this kind will
result in considerable advance on the part of the younger generation
of negroes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_MOVABLE_SCHOOL">THE MOVABLE SCHOOL</h2>
</div>


<p>A development peculiar to negro extension work is the movable
school. This is an automobile truck carrying equipment for demonstrations
and accompanied by an automobile conveying instructors.
(Fig. <a href="#image015">8</a>.) The equipment consists of farm and home tools and utensils
necessary to illustrate better methods of farming and home making.
The school goes to a home where arrangements have already been
made by the local agent, and stays from one to three days. The
novelty of the outfit and the rather spectacular nature of the occasion
guarantee a good attendance of people from the vicinity where the
work is to be done.</p>

</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The local agents and the instructors agree in advance upon what is
to be done. The program includes such things as pruning trees, terracing
land, plowing properly, building a chicken house, building a
sanitary privy, grading fruit, eggs, and vegetables, dressing chickens,
making fireless cookers, canning, making work dresses and aprons,
and whitewashing or painting the house and outbuildings. The
people in attendance are divided into small groups and several
enterprises are carried on at the same time. After the various jobs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
are completed, the whole crowd makes a tour of inspection and much
incidental instruction is driven home by those in charge. In addition
to having specialists in farming and home making, the school
usually carries a public-health nurse who gives much needed instruction
and demonstration. A necessary part of the equipment is a
projector for showing films and slides during meetings at the school
or church. Equipment is also carried to facilitate games and play
for a short time every day after the regular work is done.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that much interest has been manifested in the
movable school, it may be desirable to consider it from a strictly extension
point of view. First, in the communities where the negro
population is densest and where their welfare has been most neglected,
more simple instruction and demonstration by the specialists and
agents themselves are necessary. Just as fast as the farmers can
make object lessons and assume leadership themselves, just so fast
should that responsibility be passed on to them. Second, the movable
school supplements the work of the local agent and is supplemented
by it. When a home with its premises has been renovated and practically
reconstructed by the visit of a movable school, and when the
farmer and his family revolutionize their methods on the farm, then
the question arises as to how many more farmers can be influenced to
do likewise. The movable school does much to lay out the work of the
agents, and if they do not follow up such work and impress its lessons,
then little benefit is derived. However, the influence can be measured
more successfully a year after the visit of the movable school
than the day after.</p>

<p>By request of leading white citizens of Dallas County, Ala., the
movable school concentrated there for a month and covered the
whole county. Many plantation owners, bankers, and business
men visited the school and saw it in action. Their commendation
was most encouraging and inspires the hope that this enterprise may
be used to facilitate the reform and readjustment of farm and home
life among negro farmers who are to remain in the South and improve
their conditions. A prominent English woman, who recently visited
a movable school, was most favorably impressed. Her only criticism
was that it was liable to cause confusion because of the wealth
of instruction given in so short a time. She thought that the instruction
included more than could be assimilated and utilized in a week.
She rather facetiously remarked that it would not surprise her if
some of the women were to go home and put their babies down in
water glass and make “pinless outfits” for the eggs. Her observation
still further confirmed the belief that the movable school and
the local agents should be mutually helpful.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="STORIES_OF_ACHIEVEMENT">STORIES OF ACHIEVEMENT</h2>
</div>

<p>A few typical stories taken from numerous narratives of success
quoted by negro extension agents will suffice to give trends and tendencies.
Floyd Stokes, of Gloucester County, Va., told the following
story of the help given him through extension work (fig. <a href="#image017">9</a>):</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>When I got married back in 1903, I left home to begin life as a renter. The
little house to which I moved was on 3 acres of land which I worked when not
engaged in fishing or oystering. After having lived on this place three years, a
young man, the first demonstration agent I had ever heard of, came to me and
began talking soil improvement and how I could make a living out of it. Just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
about this time the agent induced me to buy 9 acres of land near by which were
for sale. Four of these acres had been cleared and there was an old house on
the land that had been used as a barn. I sawed some timber, had some doors
and windows made for the barn, and moved into my own home.</p>

<p>Under the instruction of the agent I planted the 3 rented acres to melons and
sowed cowpeas between the rows at the last cultivation to be turned under as
green manure. This crop of melons netted me $300. On the 4 cleared acres I
began soil building and the rotation of crops, as follows: In the spring I sowed
cowpeas for hay, followed by crimson clover, which was turned under the following
spring and planted to corn. Cowpeas were sown at the last cultivation. A
good crop of corn was produced the first year. The cornland was planted to
garden peas the next year, followed by crimson clover to be turned under and by
potatoes the year following. The potatoes were followed by cowpeas, which were
cut for hay in the fall. In the meantime, I had cleared the other 5 acres on
which I planted melons, followed by crimson clover to be turned under for soil
improvement.</p>

negro farmer who attributes his unusual success to following the advice and suggestions of the
negro extension agent.
</p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Back in the early days when I began work with the agent, my land was very
thin and light, being of a sandy texture; hence, it would not produce over 15
bushels to the acre. By following closely the system of crop rotation taught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
me, the same land is producing at this time an average of 45 bushels of corn per
acre and other crops are doing equally well. From a sand bed, my land has
been brought to a high state of cultivation.</p>

<p>In the fourth year after I had bought my first 9 acres, I purchased 7 additional
acres. From 1911 to 1917 I rented 13 acres adjoining the 16 acres I owned.
At the expiration of this period I succeeded in buying this piece of land, paying
cash for it at the rate of $100 per acre. Two years later I bought 20 acres more
for which I paid $3,000 in cash, making my total holdings at this time 49 acres.
The land on which my house stands cost me $800. I have since been offered
$6,000 for it. On the 20-acre plot is a good house which I rent out, although the
land is retained for my own use.</p>

<p>In 1923 I began to remodel my house. The necessary timber was cut from
the 20 acres purchased last. I planned to add all modern conveniences to the
house. A lighting system has been installed and I plan to put in a complete
water system next year. I have sheds for housing the farm tools when not in
use, and insist that they be kept
there. My net income averages
around $2,000 per year. I
have sold $1,600 worth of green
peas this season and just to-day
received $300 in small checks
from neighboring farmers for
seeds and plants grown by me.
My farm is self-supporting. I
do not buy anything that I can
grow, and sell all surplus crops.
I have eight children, all of
whom are being educated as
fast as they are ready for it.
Two of my children are graduates
of Hampton Institute.</p>

<p>I was one of the first to
take up demonstration work
in Gloucester County and
through it showed that money
could be made out of growing
garden peas and other truck
crops. Since most people at
that time were practicing fishing
and oystering, no one believed
that truck gardening
could be successful. When
my success became known,
one after the other began to
take it up until to-day Gloucester
County has become a
great trucking center.</p>

<p>What success I have had in
land buying, soil improvement,
home making, and education of my children may be credited to the extension
service through its agents who have rendered me most valuable service for
which I am deeply grateful.</p>
</div>

<p>In Gloucester County, Va., more than 90 per cent of the heads of
negro families own their own homes, the jail is usually empty, and the
courts have little to do.</p>

made a profit of over $265 through club work in 1924.

<p>One of the best records made in boys’ club work in 1924 was made
by Herschell Glenn, of Rockdale County, Ga. (Fig. <a href="#image018">10</a>.) He made
a profit of over $265 on his club work during the year and also had
for his own use 15 bushels of corn and a pig weighing 200 pounds.
He has had the satisfaction of knowing that his good work has
aroused and inspired hundreds of other boys in Georgia, including a
large number in his own community and county, who will try to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
excel his record in 1925. In reporting to his local agent he used the
following simple and expressive language:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>I had 2 acres in cotton. My total cost was $31.50; the total amount of seed
cotton, 3,150 pounds; total value of seeds and lint cotton, $289.52; net profit,
$265.85; and net profit per acre, $132.90. My corn did not do so well. I only
got 15 bushels from my acre. I hope to do better next year. My pig is fine.
I have fed her six months. She weighs 200 pounds. I am proud to be a club
boy and will continue next year.</p>
</div>

<p>A negro home demonstration agent in Wayne County, N. C., gave
a very good statement which indicates what is being done by negro
women agents in changing home conditions. It will be noted that
she followed the desirable plan of putting other people forward to
give testimony and express the sentiments of her people. There is
a fine recognition of individual effort and community cooperation
in this method of reporting which might well be commended to
extension workers generally.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>I have been in the county two years and seven months. It is a pleasure to
note the improvement of the people along every line. They eat better food,
sleep in more fresh air, are happier at work, take better care of their children,
have higher ideals, and have learned to sell the surplus food instead of wasting it
and to buy things which they need. More important than tangible results are
their changed ideas and attitude toward the work. One man speaking at a
community meeting said: “The agent has put new life into dead bones. I feel
better and am doing better and everybody in the neighborhood is doing better
whether he belongs to the club or not.” In the same meeting a woman said:
“I am 57 years of age, have 20 children, 45 grandchildren, and 7 great grandchildren,
but have learned more in two years about caring for children, my home,
and health than I had learned in 55 years before. I have 7 milk cows and 75
hens. I sell eggs, milk, butter, apples, peanuts, and a few other little things and
now I can see day breaking. I am just learning how to live.”</p>
</div>

<p>The negro home demonstration agent of Autauga County, Ala.,
sketches a general outline of progress which goes into a little more
detail in regard to the various activities. She says:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Gardening is no longer a part-time project, but is carried on through the year
by both women and girls engaged in club work. We have been able to keep
vegetables the year round, even though we have had a long dry spell. The
number of insects and other pests, such as worms and plant lice, have been kept
down by the constant use of soapsuds and wood ashes. Our winter gardens are
doing fine. I feel that beautifying the home and surroundings should get first
consideration, due to the fact that most of the time is spent in the house. Homes
have been whitewashed, yards cleaned, and flowers planted in each case. Instructions
have been given from time to time in the care and handling of a cow and
the care and handling of milk in the home. Very few women are taking this
instruction, but these few are making and saving money. One separator and six
sanitary milk pails have been bought this year. We have worked hard this
year with poultry, trying to do away with scrubs and put in more standard breeds.
I have succeeded in getting 30 women and 5 girls to buy standard-bred eggs. As
a result we have 1,300 more standard-bred chickens this year than we had last
year. Our aim is to turn out 100 pullets on each yard.</p>
</div>

<p>Canaan community in Montgomery County, Ala., furnishes a fine
example of the ultimate objective of home demonstration work among
negroes. It is a good illustration of the fact that demonstrations
are progressive. When one step is taken and success is achieved,
the very situation is a stimulus to additional steps until the whole
home and its environment become an inspiring object lesson of better
living. The following story indicates that practically all the homes
in that community are in various stages of advancement in extension
work:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Almost every house in Canaan community shows signs of effort in home
improvement, and the demonstration home of this community is now in process
of development. The house has been remodeled and the interior decoration
completed. Plans for the yards, walls, and fences are under way. This community
also leads in bedspread making, having 15 finished bedspreads. It is
the plan of the agent to have one demonstration home complete in each community
where demonstration work is carried on. The Smothers’ home at Mount
Meigs is the best example of home improvement in Montgomery County. The
State agent and the landscape specialist, with the cooperation of the county
agricultural agent, laid off the walks, surveyed the road, and planted the shrubs,
flowers, and Bermuda grass. The owner found that his two-room house was not
in keeping with his surroundings and so he decided to remodel. He and his
wife left the plans of the house entirely to the judgment of the State and county
home-demonstration agents and were satisfied with the plans for an addition of
three rooms, a kitchen, back porch, bathroom, and an 8-foot L porch. The plans
were executed by an architect at Tuskegee Institute. The construction is now
complete and as soon as the plasterers are through, the furniture will be installed.
At the request of Mr. and Mrs. Smothers, the home-demonstration agent helped
in the selection of new furniture. The curtains and draperies are being made
by the club girls of Mount Meigs, and girls of another community are framing
appropriate pictures.</p>
</div>

<p>The following extract from the report of the home-demonstration
agent of Washington County, Tex., is typical of the numerous
examples of good work accomplished by negro club girls:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Lena Williams, age 16, of Washington County, Tex., has learned to can vegetables
and make jelly and pickles so well that her services are in great demand.
This year, after attending to her work at home and keeping up her club activities,
Lena made a profit of $63 by canning for other people and even a greater profit
from the sale of some of her products, both canned and fresh. With this money
she bought a purebred Poland China pig, costing $10, and 12 purebred Rhode
Island Red pullets and 1 cockerel, costing $14. Lena also attributes her good
fortune in having some good warm, tasty apparel for school to her activity in
canning, as she invested the remaining $39 in clothes for school wear, and plans
to start a bank account from her investment in chickens and pigs.</p>
</div>

<p>It should be noted that any girl club member who makes the right
start in productive enterprises is almost sure to go ahead into other
phases of better home making and self-improvement. It is therefore
very essential to make the proper start. The initial stage from
the viewpoint of the demonstrator is most vital. The importance of
the starting point was emphasized by Seaman A. Knapp, when he
said:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Where to commence is the first problem of reform. Shall we trust the people
and commence by increasing their resources, or shall our efforts be directed to
improving farm dwellings and home conditions, the construction of better highways,
the introduction of the telephone, rural free delivery, a community library,
or improved social and religious privileges? Evidently it depends upon the
degree of advancement in rural communities. The remedy that would help one
might be utterly unapplicable to another. For example, if it were found that
the average farmer in a rural township lived in a house valued at about $100,
without barn, garden, cow, or pasture, with an insufficient supply of poultry,
and unable to read and heavily involved in debt, it would be the height of unwisdom
to commence the rural uplift by establishing a public library or even a school.
The rural toilers must be first properly nourished, clothed, and housed. It is
the order of greatest necessity. The means to do this can not be given to them
and if it were, there would be no uplift. They must be shown how to earn it by
a better tillage of the soil, and how to husband their earnings by greater thrift.
A low wage, a small amount of work accomplished in a day, and an uneconomic
use of resources are a part of any civilization limited by a low earning capacity.</p>

<p>No more frequent mistake is made than to assume that the low wage is the
result of oppression. As a rule the wage is determined by the accomplishment.
In India it requires from 14 to 24 servants to do the work of a small household,
where 2 would do it better in some portions of the United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>Upon the farm one man in the United States with a good team and modern
machinery can do the work that 50 to 100 men do in many oriental countries.
Consequently, when oriental farm laborers are paid 5 to 10 cents per day they
are paid up to their earning capacity and that capacity is insufficient to sustain
a high civilization.... In attempting to raise the condition of the colored
man, we frequently start too high up, and in talking of the higher progress talk
right over his head. When I talk to a negro citizen I never talk about the better
civilization, but about a better chicken, a better pig, or a whitewashed house.</p>

<p>At the close of the first decade of negro extension under the Smith-Lever
Act, it is well to make permanent record of some of the achievements
of the negroes in extension work, not only as a matter of recognition
and commendation, but also to set up milestones to mark
progress. At the close of the next decade these figures will have
even greater interest than now. In fact, they will increase in importance
and value with the passing of time.</p>

<p>The statistics which follow are not complete because they pertain
to the activities of negro agents only. Hundreds of white agents
have done some work with negroes, which is not reported separately.
It is probably safe to say that the numbers represented in the 1924
report might be doubled. Since a system of extension work for
negroes by negroes has been evolved, the tendency has been to turn
the responsibility over to negro agents. The most harmonious relations
prevail between white and negro agents in all the States and
white agents always stand ready to advise and help.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3>FARM DEMONSTRATION WORK</h3>
</div>

<p>During the calendar year 1924, 3,659 negro farmers undertook
demonstrations with cotton and 3,072 carried the work to completion
and submitted reports. These demonstrations represented a
total of 23,043 acres. In addition, 2,630 junior club members
planted an acre or more of cotton and 1,734 of them completed the
work and submitted reports. Many of these boys cleared more than
$100 each on their acres and some more than $200. This is not bad
for boys who attend school regularly. Making the usual allowance
of about 140 work hours in a year in the production and harvesting
of an acre of cotton, these club members earned an average of about
$1 an hour for every hour they worked.</p>

<p>Corn has always been a favorite crop for demonstrations by adults
and juniors in the South, because it is used so much for food and feed
and because it responds so well to special attention in that section of
the country. The 1924 annual reports show that 4,317 negro farmers
undertook demonstrations with corn and that 3,292 finished
them in good shape. The demonstrations covered 25,442 acres. Of
8,018 club members who planted an acre apiece, 4,308 completed the
work with marked success. If each successful demonstration should
influence only five neighbors, the totals would be impressive, and
demonstrations of outstanding size, success, and continuity are even
more far-reaching. From a demonstration viewpoint alone, it is
estimated that a million negro farmers and home makers are
being influenced effectively.</p>

<p>It is worth while to trace the influence of demonstration in increasing
the production of cotton and corn, but it is equally significant to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
trace the influence of demonstrations on the growing of other crops.
Additional attention during the last few years in the South has been
given to work with legumes. In order to continue the production of
large crops of cotton and corn there must be some soil building.
(Fig. <a href="#image022">11</a>.) This can be done most readily with such crops as cowpeas,
soy beans, vetch, velvet beans, clover, and alfalfa.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="image022" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -1em;"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>—Negro agent advising a farmer regarding the value of cowpeas, soy beans, and other legumes
for soil improvement. During 1924, negro farmers conducted 9,860 demonstrations with cowpeas,
soy beans, and other leguminous and forage crops, of which 8,358 were completed on a total
acreage of 54,366.</p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It is very encouraging to note that the negro farmers carried on
9,860 demonstrations with leguminous and other forage crops in
1924 and that 8,358 of these enterprises were completed on a total
acreage of 54,366. In connection with these totals should be considered
2,679 club members who were enrolled to grow legumes and
1,799 who completed the work on their acres. When it is considered
that most of this work was done on rented land and that most of
these crops require inoculation and special care, these figures have
unusual value. Of course all the legumes were not planted for soil-building
purposes. Some of them were cash crops and some were
grown for feed. The order of popularity of the principal crops among
these demonstrators is indicated by the number of demonstrations
begun in 1924, as follows: Cowpeas, 2,885; velvet beans, 1,498;
peanuts, 1,313; soy beans, 1,269; lespedeza, 476; and alfalfa, 272.
Vetch, which was included in a miscellaneous total of 384, is increasing
in popularity faster now than any other winter legume.</p>

<p>The success of negro farmers with such crops as sweet potatoes,
tobacco, and potatoes shows a strong tendency on their part toward
diversification in cash and food crops. During 1924, 1,817 demonstrators
were enrolled to grow sweet potatoes and 1,461 of them completed
the demonstrations and reported their results at the close of
the season. The club enrollment for this popular crop was 836, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
whom 590 completed their enterprises and reported. The enrollment
for potatoes was 993 adults and 619 juniors and the completions were
878 and 448, respectively. In tobacco demonstrations 229 men were
enrolled and 211 finished and reported. In junior extension 482
boys grew tobacco. In field-crop activities the enrollment of negro
girls has been very small, just as it has been among the whites, which
clearly indicates that the boys do most of the work on the farm and
the girls in the home.</p>

<p>As a further contribution to the effort of the South to feed itself,
the activities of negro farmers with cereals other than corn are indicative.
In 1924 demonstrations were undertaken with wheat,
oats, rye, barley, and other cereals, and 2,580 men, 983 boys, and 5
girls were enrolled, of whom 1,871 men, 682 boys, and 5 girls completed.
In these demonstrations the yields were much larger than
those of near-by farmers or county averages; frequently they were
twice or three times as large. When a person undertakes, as a representative
of his county, State, and Nation, to make an object lesson
to his neighbors, he assumes a large responsibility.</p>

<p>Some of the most successful demonstrations in truck farming,
from a financial standpoint, have been made by negroes. Good
stories of their work with melons, berries, cabbage, turnips, carrots,
celery, and other similar crops come in constantly. Some of the
enrollment figures in horticultural demonstrations deserve attention
and favorable comment. Negro farmers undertook 1,392 demonstrations
in trucking and market gardening and completed 971 with
marked success. A total of 8,729 persons were enrolled to make
object lessons in home gardens and 6,502 of them were carried
through to completion. The enrollment in fruits was 2,045, of
whom 1,403 completed. Some extraordinary service was rendered
by these farmers in spraying and pruning, which made their results
more satisfactory and their examples more potent. In fact, many
demonstrators became teachers and leaders through the merits of
their work.</p>

<p>Unusual significance may very properly be attached to the livestock
demonstrations of negro farmers. The large number of cows,
hogs, and chickens owned by them indicates increased land ownership
by negroes. It throws light also on the increased production of
feed crops. The annual reports for 1924 show that 9,936 adult
farmers and farm women were enrolled as livestock demonstrators,
of whom 7,379 completed the year’s work and submitted reports.
It is safe to assume that most of the 264,432 animals used in these
demonstrations were purebred. Likewise, it means progress when
it is realized that negro boys and girls cared for 102,070 high-class
farm animals in their club enterprises. The enrollment of negro
boys and girls in livestock work is worthy of the detailed statement
given in Table 2.</p>

<p>Some idea of the substantial nature of the accomplishments of
negro agents may be found in the record for 1924, which shows that
they helped to procure better sires for the flocks and herds of 3,552
farms and that they had flocks and herds culled on 4,848 farms.
They also introduced better balanced feeding for farm animals on
9,520 farms.</p>

<p>Negro demonstrators used 68,126 tons of fertilizer and 8,288 tons
of lime in their exemplary farm enterprises in 1924, and they plowed
under 13,547 acres of cover and green-manure crops in their soil-improvement
operations. Terracing was done on 1,738 farms and
soil erosion was thereby prevented on 43,299 acres. Drainage systems
were installed on 573 farms and 18,405 acres were thereby made
more productive and valuable.</p>

<p>The climax of negro extension work comes in the constructive
features just as for the whites. Special import should therefore
be attached to the fact that the agents had 463 barns, 411 hog houses,
and 787 poultry houses built according to approved plans. Some
rural-engineering work of a constructive nature was done on 3,967
farms under the guidance of negro extension agents. All this development
means that thousands of the best negroes are learning lessons
of thrift, economy, and enterprise. They are coming to realize more
and more the importance of owning land and building permanent
homes. Another decade will probably show even greater results
along these lines.</p>

<h3>HOME DEMONSTRATION WORK</h3>
</div>

<p>It is certainly very gratifying to note that a large number of negro
women and girls are doing excellent home demonstration work.
When it is remembered that they have to help a great deal in cotton,
tobacco, and other fields, there is unusual significance in the fact
that they are willing and anxious to take part in the special activities
which make for better living and better homes. In 1924, 21,509
women and 27,114 girls were enrolled in the various activities which
pertain definitely to the improvement of the home.</p>

<p>It is interesting, also, to compare the figures on home gardens
with those on food preservation and preparation. There seems to
be a logical sequence here. During the year, 12,355 women and
14,641 girls were enrolled in home gardening; 13,911 women and
13,826 girls, in food preservation; and 14,731 women and 16,537
girls, in food preparation. As a rule, the work begins with garden
demonstrations, so it would seem that the interest increases as the
work progresses. It should be remembered also that women and
girls did most of the work with poultry. The proportion of members
completing these demonstrations and the number of method
demonstrations necessary for instruction were about the same as the
averages of agents in other parts of the country and in other lines of
work.</p>

<p>Gardening work is begun with the most staple and standard crops
and soon leads to winter and perennial gardens and the growing of
small fruits. Wherever home ownership obtains, the garden demonstrations
are followed by orchard and lawn demonstrations. Fruit
trees suitable to climatic and soil conditions are planted around the
homes, and such activities always approach their climax in beautified
front yards and lawns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>The number of dwellings constructed and remodeled under the
guidance of negro women agents and the number of club members
demonstrating the beautification of home grounds indicate clearly
the progress of negro home demonstration work. Such activities
show that other steps have been taken before the family is ready to
build. They show, also, that a great deal of interest has been
aroused and that the earning power of the people must have been
increased to make such improvements possible. In 1924, 569 houses
were built in accordance with plans furnished by negro extension
agents and 1,002 houses were remodeled in accordance with the suggestions
made by them. The fact that so much work was done to
make homes attractive indicates that demonstrators are anxious to
make improvements. This point is still further emphasized by the
number of members who were enrolled in demonstrations in the
beautification of home grounds. A total of 6,433 women and 6,427
girls took up this important enterprise; in 1,336 homes the grounds
were laid out according to a definite landscape plan; and 335 school
and community grounds were planted according to plans.</p>

<p>Paint and whitewash are good indexes of improvement and prosperity.
Demonstrations of this nature exert a fine influence from
the standpoint of morals and civilization. In 1924, 2,259 dwellings
were painted or whitewashed as the result of extension influence.
Many of the dwellings which were built or remodeled installed running
water and lighting and heating systems. Altogether, 151 houses
installed one or more of these improvements.</p>

<p>Perhaps no phases of home demonstration work are more valuable
among negroes than sanitation and health, which were exemplified
by more than 10,000 negro homes. In 2,361 homes the doors and
windows were screened and in 3,781 homes other methods of insect
control and extermination were followed. In most Southern States,
negro agents have definite plans with blue prints for the construction
of sanitary closets. These plans were followed in 1,890 homes. A
total of 9,734 women and 10,351 girls were enrolled in home-health
and sanitation demonstrations. The agents gave more than 5,000
demonstrations by way of instruction along this line. The club
members and the home demonstrators took much interest in home
nursing, first aid, care of teeth, care of skin, good posture, prevention
of colds, and similar health activities which the agents were emphasizing.</p>

<p>The statistics on house furnishings by negro women and girls compare
favorably with their activities along other lines. (Fig. <a href="#image026">12</a>.)
During 1924, 7,688 women and 8,656 girls were enrolled to make or
buy and install certain house furnishings suggested by the agents.
More than 3,000 individuals conducted demonstrations in treating
woodwork, walls, and floors. As a result of demonstrations carried
on in house furnishings, 4,938 improvements were made in bedrooms,
1,744 in living rooms, 2,190 in dining rooms, and 1,717 in other rooms
of the house.</p>

<p>During the year 4,962 demonstrations in home management were
conducted by women and girls, most of them pertaining to the
kitchen and its equipment. Negro women and girls in their demonstration
activities rearranged 2,226 kitchens according to plans outlined
by negro extension agents, installed 326 fireless cookers, 312
kitchen sinks, 1,198 kitchen cabinets, and thousands of other articles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
of equipment and convenience in the kitchen. In equipping the
home laundry 277 hand washing machines and 26 power washing
machines were obtained. The women and girls also bought 623
electric and gasoline irons and 70 power vacuum cleaners. The
record shows that 4,008 club members and demonstrators followed
improved laundry practices for the first time.</p>

<h3>AGENTS’ ACTIVITIES</h3>
</div>

<p>In the conduct of demonstration work with negroes the agents
made visits to 28,410 farms and 26,515 homes. It required 86,824
farm visits and 49,334 home visits to get the results heretofore reported.
It therefore seems that each demonstration farm required an average
of three visits and each demonstration home an average of about two
visits. If the demonstrations are large and successful enough, the
agents will be justified in increasing their visits and also in further
magnifying them with field meetings and tours where the demonstrations
will be greatly emphasized and the good influences extended.</p>

</figure>

<p>It may be noted further that the agents spent 37,418 days in the
field and 15,435 days in the office. The negro agents reported 46,100
method and result demonstration meetings with a total attendance
of 820,366. This was in addition to 1,863 special meetings for demonstrators
and leaders, 358 short courses, and 107 camps for special
training. Altogether, more than a million people attended the
special and regular meetings for the promotion of extension work
among negroes. To these impressive totals the number of fairs and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
exhibits should be added. Negroes made exhibits at 815 different
community, county, and State fairs, which were seen and studied
by thousands of people. Lantern slides and motion pictures were
shown at more than 500 meetings.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="OUTLOOK">OUTLOOK</h2>
</div>

<p>The extension work for negroes and by negroes has been built up
practically in the last 10 years. It is a wonderful development in
such a short time. It took about the same length of time to build a
similar organization for white people. When it is remembered that
negro work has been established in a period of transition, turmoil, and
readjustment, the significance is all the more remarkable. It is a
fine tribute to the good work of the negro agents that, when the
period of retrenchment came soon after the World War, their force
and their appropriations were the only ones which were not reduced.
With this solid foundation, with this inspiring record, and with this
successful history the near future holds out much hope for even more
rapid development. There is no field of education in this country
now where greater good can be accomplished by earnest, devoted
agents working along the right lines.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
